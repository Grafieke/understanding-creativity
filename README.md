			Creativity
		</h1>
		<p>
			<strong>Creativity</strong> is a phenomenon whereby something new and somehow valuable is formed. The created item may be intangible (such as an idea, a scientific theory, a musical composition, or a joke) or a physical object (such as an invention, a literary work, or a painting).
		</p>
			
		<p>	
			Scholarly interest in creativity involves many definitions and concepts pertaining to a number of disciplines: engineering, psychology, cognitive science, education, philosophy (particularly philosophy of science), technology, theology, sociology, linguistics, business studies, songwriting, and economics, covering the relations between creativity and general intelligence, mental and neurological processes, personality type and creative ability, creativity and mental health; the potential for fostering creativity through education and training, especially as augmented by technology; the maximization of creativity for national economic benefit, and the application of creative resources to improve the effectiveness of teaching and learning.
		</p>

		<h1>
			Definition
		</h1>	

		<p>
			In a summary of scientific research into creativity, Michael Mumford suggested: "Over the course of the last decade, however, we seem to have reached a general agreement that creativity involves the production of novel, useful products" (Mumford, 2003, p. 110),[1] or, in Robert Sternberg's words, the production of "something original and worthwhile".[2] Authors have diverged dramatically in their precise definitions beyond these general commonalities: Peter Meusburger reckons that over a hundred different analyses can be found in the literature.[3] As an illustration, one definition given by Dr. E. Paul Torrance described it as "a process of becoming sensitive to problems, deficiencies, gaps in knowledge, missing elements, disharmonies, and so on; identifying the difficulty; searching for solutions, making guesses, or formulating hypotheses about the deficiencies: testing and retesting these hypotheses and possibly modifying and retesting them; and finally communicating the results."[4]
		</p>

		<h1>
			Aspects
		</h1>

		<p>
			Theories of creativity (particularly investigation of why some people are more creative than others) have focused on a variety of aspects. The dominant factors are usually identified as "the four Ps" — process, product, person, and place (according to Mel Rhodes).[5] A focus on <em>process</em> is shown in cognitive approaches that try to describe thought mechanisms and techniques for creative thinking. Theories invoking divergent rather than convergent thinking (such as Guilford), or those describing the staging of the creative process (such as Wallas) are primarily theories of creative process. A focus on creative <em>product</em> usually appears in attempts to measure creativity (psychometrics, see below) and in creative ideas framed as successful memes.[6] The psychometric approach to creativity reveals that it also involves the ability to produce more.[7] A focus on the nature of the creative <em>person</em> considers more general intellectual habits, such as openness, levels of ideation, autonomy, expertise, exploratory behavior, and so on. A focus on <em>place</em> considers the circumstances in which creativity flourishes, such as degrees of autonomy, access to resources, and the nature of gatekeepers. Creative lifestyles are characterized by nonconforming attitudes and behaviors as well as flexibility.[7]
		</p>

		<h1>
			Etymology
		</h1>

		<p>
			The lexeme in the English word <em>creativity</em> comes from the Latin term <i lang="la">creō</i> "to create, make": its derivational suffixes also come from Latin. The word "create" appeared in English as early as the 14th century, notably in Chaucer, to indicate divine creation[8] (in The Parson's Tale[9]). However, its modern meaning as an act of human creation did not emerge until after the Enlightenment.[8]

			History of the concept

		<p>
			Main article: History of the concept of creativity
		</p>

		<h2>
			Ancient views
		</h2>

		<img src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity#/media/File:Plato-raphael.jpg" alt="Plato">

		<p>
			Most ancient cultures, including thinkers of Ancient Greece,[10] Ancient China, and Ancient India,[11] lacked the concept of creativity, seeing art as a form of discovery and not creation. The ancient Greeks had no terms corresponding to "to create" or "creator" except for the expression "<i lang="el">poiein</i>" ("to make"), which only applied to <i lang="el">poiesis</i> (poetry) and to the <i lang="el">poietes</i> (poet, or "maker") who made it. Plato did not believe in art as a form of creation. Asked in The Republic,[12] "Will we say, of a painter, that he makes something?", he answers, "Certainly not, he merely imitates."[10]
		</p>

		<p>
			It is commonly argued that the notion of "creativity" originated in Western culture through Christianity, as a matter of divine inspiration.[8] According to the historian Daniel J. Boorstin, "the early Western conception of creativity was the Biblical story of creation given in the Genesis."[13] However, this is not creativity in the modern sense, which did not arise until the Renaissance. In the Judaeo-Christian tradition, creativity was the sole province of God; humans were not considered to have the ability to create something new except as an expression of God's work.[14] A concept similar to that of Christianity existed in Greek culture, for instance, Muses were seen as mediating inspiration from the Gods.[15] Romans and Greeks invoked the concept of an external creative "daemon" (Greek) or "genius" (Latin), linked to the sacred or the divine. However, none of these views are similar to the modern concept of creativity, and the individual was not seen as the cause of creation until the Renaissance.[16] It was during the Renaissance that creativity was first seen, not as a conduit for the divine, but from the abilities of "great men".[16]
		</p>

		<h2>
			The Enlightenment and after
		</h2>

		<p>
			The rejection of creativity in favor of discovery and the belief that individual creation was a conduit of the divine would dominate the West probably until the Renaissance and even later.[14] The development of the modern concept of creativity begins in the Renaissance, when creation began to be perceived as having originated from the abilities of the individual, and not God. This could be attributed to the leading intellectual movement of the time, aptly named humanism, which developed an intensely human-centric outlook on the world, valuing the intellect and achievement of the individual.[17] From this philosophy arose the Renaissance man (or polymath), an individual who embodies the principals of humanism in their ceaseless courtship with knowledge and creation.[18] One of the most well-known and immensely accomplished examples is Leonardo da Vinci.
		</p>

		<p>
			However, this shift was gradual and would not become immediately apparent until the Enlightenment.[16] By the 18th century and the Age of Enlightenment, mention of creativity (notably in aesthetics), linked with the concept of imagination, became more frequent.[19] In the writing of Thomas Hobbes, imagination became a key element of human cognition;[8] William Duff was one of the first to identify imagination as a quality of genius, typifying the separation being made between talent (productive, but breaking no new ground) and genius.[15]
		</p>

		<p>
			As a direct and independent topic of study, creativity effectively received no attention until the 19th century.[15] Runco and Albert argue that creativity as the subject of proper study began seriously to emerge in the late 19th century with the increased interest in individual differences inspired by the arrival of Darwinism. In particular, they refer to the work of Francis Galton, who through his eugenicist outlook took a keen interest in the heritability of intelligence, with creativity taken as an aspect of genius.[8]
		</p>

		<p>
			In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, leading mathematicians and scientists such as Hermann von Helmholtz (1896) and Henri Poincaré (1908) began to reflect on and publicly discuss their creative processes.
		</p>

		<h2>
			Twentieth century to the present day
		</h2>

		<p>
			The insights of Poincaré and von Helmholtz were built on in early accounts of the creative process by pioneering theorists such as Graham Wallas[20] and Max Wertheimer. In his work <cite>Art of Thought</cite>, published in 1926, Wallas presented one of the first models of the creative process. In the Wallas stage model, creative insights and illuminations may be explained by a process consisting of 5 stages:
		</p>

		<oL>
			<li><e>preparation</e> (preparatory work on a problem that focuses the individual's mind on the problem and explores the problem's dimensions);</li>
			<li><em>incubation</em> (the creative person gets a "feeling" that a solution is on its way);</li>
			<li><em>illumination</em> or insight (where the creative idea bursts forth from its preconscious processing into conscious awareness);</li>
			<li><em>verification</em> (where the idea is consciously verified, elaborated, and then applied).</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p>
			Wallas' model is often treated as four stages, with "intimation" seen as a sub-stage.
		</p>

		<p>
			Wallas considered creativity to be a legacy of the evolutionary process, which allowed humans to quickly adapt to rapidly changing environments. Simonton[21] provides an updated perspective on this view in his book, <cite>Origins of genius: Darwinian perspectives on creativity</cite>.
		</p>

		<p>
			In 1927, Alfred North Whitehead gave the Gifford Lectures at the University of Edinburgh, later published as <cite>Process and Reality</cite>.[22] He is credited with having coined the term "creativity" to serve as the ultimate category of his metaphysical scheme: "Whitehead actually coined the term – our term, still the preferred currency of exchange among literature, science, and the arts. . . a term that quickly became so popular, so omnipresent, that its invention within living memory, and by Alfred North Whitehead of all people, quickly became occluded".[23]
		</p>

		<p>
			The formal psychometric measurement of creativity, from the standpoint of orthodox psychological literature, is usually considered to have begun with J. P. Guilford's 1950 address to the American Psychological Association, which helped popularize the topic[24] and focus attention on a scientific approach to conceptualizing creativity. (It should be noted that the London School of Psychology had instigated psychometric studies of creativity as early as 1927 with the work of H. L. Hargreaves into the Faculty of Imagination,[25] but it did not have the same impact.) Statistical analysis led to the recognition of creativity (as measured) as a separate aspect of human cognition to IQ-type intelligence, into which it had previously been subsumed. Guilford's work suggested that above a threshold level of IQ, the relationship between creativity and classically measured intelligence broke down.[26]
		</p>

		<h2>
			"Four C" model
		</h2>

		<p>
			James C. Kaufman and Beghetto introduced a "four C" model of creativity; <em>mini-c</em> ("transformative learning" involving "personally meaningful interpretations of experiences, actions, and insights"), <em>little-c</em> (everyday problem solving and creative expression), <em>Pro-C</em> (exhibited by people who are professionally or vocationally creative though not necessarily eminent) and <em>Big-C</em> (creativity considered great in the given field). This model was intended to help accommodate models and theories of creativity that stressed competence as an essential component and the historical transformation of a creative domain as the highest mark of creativity. It also, the authors argued, made a useful framework for analyzing creative processes in individuals.[27]
		</p>

		<p>
			The contrast of terms "Big C" and "Little c" has been widely used. Kozbelt, Beghetto and Runco use a little-c/Big-C model to review major theories of creativity.[26] Margaret Boden distinguishes between h-creativity (historical) and p-creativity (personal).[28]
		</p>

		<p>
			Robinson[29] and Anna Craft[30] have focused on creativity in a general population, particularly with respect to education. Craft makes a similar distinction between "high" and "little c" creativity.[30] and cites Ken Robinson as referring to "high" and "democratic" creativity. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi[31] has defined creativity in terms of those individuals judged to have made significant creative, perhaps domain-changing contributions. Simonton has analysed the career trajectories of eminent creative people in order to map patterns and predictors of creative productivity.[32]
		</p>

		<h1>
			Theories of creative processes
		</h1>

		<p>
			There has been much empirical study in psychology and cognitive science of the processes through which creativity occurs. Interpretation of the results of these studies has led to several possible explanations of the sources and methods of creativity.
		</p>

		<h2>
			Incubation
		</h2>

		<p>
			Incubation is a temporary break from creative problem solving that can result in insight.[33] There has been some empirical research looking at whether, as the concept of "incubation" in Wallas' model implies, a period of interruption or rest from a problem may aid creative problem-solving. Ward[34] lists various hypotheses that have been advanced to explain why incubation may aid creative problem-solving, and notes how some empirical evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that incubation aids creative problem-solving in that it enables "forgetting" of misleading clues. Absence of incubation may lead the problem solver to become fixated on inappropriate strategies of solving the problem.[35] This work disputes the earlier hypothesis that creative solutions to problems arise mysteriously from the unconscious mind while the conscious mind is occupied on other tasks.[36] This earlier hypothesis is discussed in Csikszentmihalyi's five phase model of the creative process which describes incubation as a time that your unconscious takes over. This allows for unique connections to be made without your consciousness trying to make logical order out of the problem.[37]
		</p>

		<h2>
			Convergent and divergent thinking
		</h2>

		<p>
			J. P. Guilford[38] drew a distinction between convergent and divergent production (commonly renamed convergent and divergent thinking). Convergent thinking involves aiming for a single, correct solution to a problem, whereas divergent thinking involves creative generation of multiple answers to a set problem. Divergent thinking is sometimes used as a synonym for creativity in psychology literature. Other researchers have occasionally used the terms <em>flexible</em> thinking or fluid intelligence, which are roughly similar to (but not synonymous with) creativity.[citation needed]
		</p>

		<h2>
			Creative cognition approach
		</h2>

		<p>
			In 1992, Finke et al. proposed the "Geneplore" model, in which creativity takes place in two phases: a generative phase, where an individual constructs mental representations called preinventive structures, and an exploratory phase where those structures are used to come up with creative ideas. Some evidence shows that when people use their imagination to develop new ideas, those ideas are heavily structured in predictable ways by the properties of existing categories and concepts.[39] Weisberg[40] argued, by contrast, that creativity only involves ordinary cognitive processes yielding extraordinary results.
		</p>

		<h2>
			The Explicit–Implicit Interaction (EII) theory
		</h2>

		<p>
			Helie and Sun[41] recently proposed a unified framework for understanding creativity in problem solving, namely the Explicit–Implicit Interaction (EII) theory of creativity. This new theory constitutes an attempt at providing a more unified explanation of relevant phenomena (in part by reinterpreting/integrating various fragmentary existing theories of incubation and insight).
		</p>

		<p>
			The EII theory relies mainly on five basic principles, namely:
		</p>

		<ol>
			<li>The co-existence of and the difference between explicit and implicit knowledge;</li>
			<li>The simultaneous involvement of implicit and explicit processes in most tasks;</li>
			<li>The redundant representation of explicit and implicit knowledge;</li>
			<li>The integration of the results of explicit and implicit processing;</li>
			<li>The iterative (and possibly bidirectional) processing.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>
			A computational implementation of the theory was developed based on the CLARION cognitive architecture and used to simulate relevant human data. This work represents an initial step in the development of process-based theories of creativity encompassing incubation, insight, and various other related phenomena.
		</p>

		<h2>
			Conceptual blending
		</h2>

		<p>
			<cite>Main article: Conceptual blending</cite>
		</p>

		<p>
			In <cite>The Act of Creation</cite>, Arthur Koestler introduced the concept of <em>bisociation</em> — that creativity arises as a result of the intersection of two quite different frames of reference.[42] This idea was later developed into conceptual blending. In the 1990s, various approaches in cognitive science that dealt with metaphor, analogy, and structure mapping have been converging, and a new integrative approach to the study of creativity in science, art and humor has emerged under the label conceptual blending.
		</p>

		<h2>
			Honing theory
		</h2>

		<p>
			Honing theory, developed principally by psychologist Liane Gabora, posits that creativity arises due to the self-organizing, self-mending nature of a worldview. The creative process is a way in which the individual hones (and re-hones) an integrated worldview. Honing theory places emphasis not only on the externally visible creative outcome but also the internal cognitive restructuring and repair of the worldview brought about by the creative process. When faced with a creatively demanding task, there is an interaction between the conception of the task and the worldview. The conception of the task changes through interaction with the worldview, and the worldview changes through interaction with the task. This interaction is reiterated until the task is complete, at which point not only is the task conceived of differently, but the worldview is subtly or drastically transformed as it follows the natural tendency of a worldview to attempt to resolve dissonance and seek internal consistency amongst its components, whether they be ideas, attitudes, or bits of knowledge.
		</p>

		<p>
			A central feature of honing theory is the notion of a potentiality state.[43] Honing theory posits that creative thought proceeds not by searching through and randomly ‘mutating’ predefined possibilities, but by drawing upon associations that exist due to overlap in the distributed neural cell assemblies that participate in the encoding of experiences in memory. Midway through the creative process one may have made associations between the current task and previous experiences, but not yet disambiguated which aspects of those previous experiences are relevant to the current task. Thus the creative idea may feel ‘half-baked’. It is at that point that it can be said to be in a potentiality state, because how it will actualize depends on the different internally or externally generated contexts it interacts with.
		</p>

		<p>
			Honing theory is held to explain certain phenomena not dealt with by other theories of creativity, for example, how different works by the same creator are observed in studies to exhibit a recognizable style or 'voice' even through in different creative outlets. This is not predicted by theories of creativity that emphasize chance processes or the accumulation of expertise, but it is predicted by honing theory, according to which personal style reflects the creator's uniquely structured worldview. Another example is in the environmental stimulus for creativity. Creativity is commonly considered to be fostered by a supportive, nurturing, trustworthy environment conducive to self-actualization. However, research shows that creativity is also associated with childhood adversity, which would stimulate honing.
		</p>

		<h2>
			Everyday imaginative thought
		</h2>

		<p>
			In everyday thought, people often spontaneously imagine alternatives to reality when they think "if only...".[44] Their counterfactual thinking is viewed as an example of everyday creative processes.[45] It has been proposed that the creation of counterfactual alternatives to reality depends on similar cognitive processes to rational thought.[46]
		</p>

		<h1>
			Assessing individual creative ability
		</h1>

		<h2>
			Creativity quotient
		</h2>

		<p>
			Several attempts have been made to develop a creativity quotient of an individual similar to the intelligence quotient (IQ); however, these have been unsuccessful.[47]
		</p>

		<h2>
			Psychometric approach
		</h2>

		<p>
			J. P. Guilford's group,[38] which pioneered the modern psychometric study of creativity, constructed several tests to measure creativity in 1967:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Plot Titles, where participants are given the plot of a story and asked to write original titles.</li>
			<li>Quick Responses is a word-association test scored for uncommonness.</li>
			<li>Figure Concepts, where participants were given simple drawings of objects and individuals and asked to find qualities or features that are common by two or more drawings; these were scored for uncommonness.</li>
			<li>Unusual Uses is finding unusual uses for common everyday objects such as bricks.</li>
			<li>Remote Associations, where participants are asked to find a word between two given words (e.g. Hand _____ Call)</li>
			<li>Remote Consequences, where participants are asked to generate a list of consequences of unexpected events (e.g. loss of gravity)</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			Building on Guilford's work, Torrance[48] developed the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking in 1966.[49] They involved simple tests of divergent thinking and other problem-solving skills, which were scored on:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Fluency – The total number of interpretable, meaningful, and relevant ideas generated in response to the stimulus.</li>
			<li>Originality – The statistical rarity of the responses among the test subjects.</li>
			<li>Elaboration – The amount of detail in the responses.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			The Creativity Achievement Questionnaire, a self-report test that measures creative achievement across 10 domains, was described in 2005 and shown to be reliable and valid when compared to other measures of creativity and to independent evaluation of creative output.[50]
		</p>

		<p>
			Such tests, sometimes called Divergent Thinking (DT) tests have been both supported[51] and criticized.[52]
		</p>

		<p>
			Considerable progress has been made in automated scoring of divergent thinking tests using semantic approach. When compared to human raters, NLP techniques were shown to be reliable and valid in scoring the originality (when compared to human raters).[53][54] The reported computer programs were able to achieve a correlation of 0.60 and 0.72 respectively to human graders.
		</p>

		<p>
			Semantic networks were also used to devise originality scores that yielded significant correlations with socio-personal measures.[55] Most recently, an NSF-funded[56] team of researchers led by James C. Kaufman and Mark A. Runco[57] combined expertise in creativity research, natural language processing, computational linguistics, and statistical data analysis to devise a scalable system for computerized automated testing (SparcIt Creativity Index Testing system). This system enabled automated scoring of DT tests that is reliable, objective, and scalable, thus addressing most of the issues of DT tests that had been found and reported.[52] The resultant computer system was able to achieve a correlation of 0.73 to human graders.[58]
		</p>

		<h2>
			Social-personality approach
		</h2>

		<p>
			Some researchers have taken a social-personality approach to the measurement of creativity. In these studies, personality traits such as independence of judgement, self-confidence, attraction to complexity, aesthetic orientation, and risk-taking are used as measures of the creativity of individuals.[24] A meta-analysis by Gregory Feist showed that creative people tend to be "more open to new experiences, less conventional and less conscientious, more self-confident, self-accepting, driven, ambitious, dominant, hostile, and impulsive." Openness, conscientiousness, self-acceptance, hostility, and impulsivity had the strongest effects of the traits listed.[59] Within the framework of the Big Five model of personality, some consistent traits have emerged.[60] Openness to experience has been shown to be consistently related to a whole host of different assessments of creativity.[61] Among the other Big Five traits, research has demonstrated subtle differences between different domains of creativity. Compared to non-artists, artists tend to have higher levels of openness to experience and lower levels of conscientiousness, while scientists are more open to experience, conscientious, and higher in the confidence-dominance facets of extraversion compared to non-scientists.[59]

		<h1>
			Creativity and intelligence
		</h1>

		<p>
			The potential relationship between creativity and intelligence has been of interest since the late 1900s, when a multitude of influential studies – from Getzels &amp; Jackson,[62] Barron,[63] Wallach &amp; Kogan,[64] and Guilford[65] – focused not only on creativity, but also on intelligence. This joint focus highlights both the theoretical and practical importance of the relationship: researchers are interested not only if the constructs are related, but also how and why.[66]
		</p>

		<p>
			There are multiple theories accounting for their relationship, with the 3 main theories as follows:
		</p>


		<ul>
			<li>Threshold Theory – Intelligence is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for creativity. There is a moderate positive relationship between creativity and intelligence until IQ ~120.[63][65]</li>
			<li>Certification Theory – Creativity is not intrinsically related to intelligence. Instead, individuals are required to meet the requisite level intelligence in order to gain a certain level of education/work, which then in turn offers the opportunity to be creative.</li> 
			<li>Displays of creativity are moderated by intelligence.[67]</li>
			<li>Interference Theory – Extremely high intelligence might interfere with creative ability.[68]</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			Sternberg and O’Hara[69] proposed a framework of 5 possible relationships between creativity and intelligence:
		</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Creativity is a subset of intelligence</li>
			<li>Intelligence is a subset of creativity</li>
			<li>Creativity and intelligence are overlapping constructs</li>
			<li>Creativity and intelligence are part of the same construct (coincident sets)</li>
			<li>Creativity and intelligence are distinct constructs (disjoint sets)</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>
			Creativity as a subset of intelligence
		</h2>

		<p>
			In this relationship model, intelligence is a key component in the development of creativity.
		</p>

		<p>
			<em>Theories of creativity that include intelligence as a subset of creativity</em>
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Sternberg &amp; Lubart’s Investment Theory.[76][77] Using the metaphor of a stock market, they demonstrate that creative thinkers are like good investors – they buy low and sell high (in their ideas). Like under/low-valued stock, creative individuals generate unique ideas that are initially rejected by other people. The creative individual has to persevere, and convince the others of the ideas value. After convincing the others, and thus increasing the ideas value, the creative individual ‘sells high’ by leaving the idea with the other people, and moves onto generating another idea. According to this theory, six distinct, but related elements contribute to successful creativity: intelligence, knowledge, thinking styles, personality, motivation, and environment. Intelligence is just one of the six factors that can either solely, or in conjunction with the other five factors, generate creative thoughts.</li>
			<li>Amabile’s Componential Model of Creativity.[78][79] In this model, there are 3 within-individual components needed for creativity – domain-relevant skills, creativity-relevant processes, and task motivation – and 1 component external to the individual: their surrounding social environment. Creativity requires a confluence of all components. High creativity will result when an individual is: intrinsically motivated, possesses both a high level of domain-relevant skills and has high skills in creative thinking, and is working in a highly creative environment.</li>
			<li>Amusement Park Theoretical Model.[80] In this 4-step theory, both domain-specific and generalist views are integrated into a model of creativity. The researchers make use of the metaphor of the amusement park to demonstrate that within each of these creative levels, intelligence plays a key role:
				<ul>
					<li>To get into the amusement park, there are initial requirements (e.g., time/transport to go to the park). Initial requirements (like intelligence) are necessary, but not sufficient for creativity. They are more like prerequisites for creativity, and if an individual does not possess the basic level of the initial requirement (intelligence), then they will not be able to generate creative thoughts/behaviour.</li>
					<li>Secondly are the subcomponents – general thematic areas – that increase in specificity. Like choosing which type of amusement park to visit (e.g. a zoo or a water park), these areas relate to the areas in which someone could be creative (e.g. poetry).</li>
					<li>Thirdly, there are specific domains. After choosing the type of park to visit e.g. waterpark, you then have to choose which specific park to go to. Within the poetry domain, there are many different types (e.g. free verse, riddles, sonnet, etc.) that have to be selected from.</li>
					<li>Lastly, there are micro-domains. These are the specific tasks that reside within each domain e.g. individual lines in a free verse poem / individual rides at the waterpark.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>
			Creativity and intelligence as overlapping yet distinct constructs
		</h2>

		<p>
			This possible relationship concerns creativity and intelligence as distinct, but intersecting constructs.
		</p>

		<p>
			<em>Theories that include Creativity and Intelligence as Overlapping Yet Distinct Constructs</em>
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Renzulli’s Three-Ring Conception of Giftedness.[81] In this conceptualisation, giftedness occurs as a result from the overlap of above average intellectual ability, creativity, and task commitment. Under this view, creativity and intelligence are distinct constructs, but they do overlap under the correct conditions.</li>
			<li>PASS theory of intelligence. In this theory, the planning component – relating to the ability to solve problems, make decisions and take action – strongly overlaps with the concept of creativity.[82]</li>
			<li>Threshold Theory (TT). A number of previous research findings have suggested that a threshold exists in the relationship between creativity and intelligence – both constructs are moderately positively correlated up to an IQ of ~120. Above this threshold of an IQ of 120, if there is a relationship at all, it is small and weak.[62][63][83] TT posits that a moderate level of intelligence is necessary for creativity.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			In support of the TT, Barron[63][84] reported finding a non-significant correlation between creativity and intelligence in a gifted sample; and a significant correlation in a non-gifted sample. Yamamoto[85] in a sample of secondary school children, reported a significant correlation between creativity and intelligence of <em>r</em> = .3, and reported no significant correlation when the sample consisted of gifted children. Fuchs-Beauchamp et al.[86] in a sample of preschoolers found that creativity and intelligence correlated from <em>r</em> = .19 to <em>r</em> = .49 in the group of children who had an IQ below the threshold; and in the group above the threshold, the correlations were <em>r</em> = &lt;.12. Cho et al.[87] reported a correlation of .40 between creativity and intelligence in the average IQ group of a sample of adolescents and adults; and a correlation of close to <em>r</em> = .0 for the high IQ group. Jauk et al.[88] found support for the TT, but only for measures of creative potential; not creative performance.
		</p>

		<p>
			Much modern day research reports findings against TT. Wai et al.[89] in a study using data from the longitudinal Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth – a cohort of elite students from early adolescence into adulthood – found that differences in SAT scores at age 13 were predictive of creative real-life outcomes 20 years later. Kim’s[90] meta-analysis of 21 studies did not find any supporting evidence for TT, and instead negligible correlations were reported between intelligence, creativity, and divergent thinking both below and above IQ's of 120. Preckel et al.,[91] investigating fluid intelligence and creativity, reported small correlations of <em>r</em> = .3 to <em>r</em> = .4 across all levels of cognitive ability.

		<p>
			Under this view, researchers posit that there are no differences in the mechanisms underlying creativity in those used in normal problem solving; and in normal problem solving, there is no need for creativity. Thus, creativity and Intelligence (problem solving) are the same thing. Perkins[92] referred to this as the ‘nothing-special’ view.

			Weisberg &amp; Alba[93] examined problem solving by having participants complete the 9-dot problem (see Thinking outside the box#Nine dots puzzle) – where the participants are asked to connect all 9 dots in the 3 rows of 3 dots using 4 straight lines or less, without lifting their pen or tracing the same line twice. The problem can only be solved if the lines go outside the boundaries of the square of dots. Results demonstrated that even when participants were given this insight, they still found it difficult to solve the problem, thus showing that to successfully complete the task it is not just insight (or creativity) that is required.

			Creativity and intelligence as disjoint sets
		</h2>

		<p>
			In this view, creativity and intelligence are completely different, unrelated constructs.

			Getzels and Jackson[62] administered 5 creativity measures to a group of 449 children from grades 6-12, and compared these test findings to results from previously administered (by the school) IQ tests. They found that the correlation between the creativity measures and IQ was <em>r</em> = .26. The high creativity group scored in the top 20% of the overall creativity measures, but were not included in the top 20% of IQ scorers. The high intelligence group scored the opposite: they scored in the top 20% for IQ, but were outside the top 20% scorers for creativity, thus showing that creativity and intelligence are distinct and unrelated.

			However, this work has been heavily criticised. Wallach and Kogan[64] highlighted that the creativity measures were not only weakly related to one another (to the extent that they were no more related to one another than they were with IQ), but they seemed to also draw upon non-creative skills. McNemar[94] noted that there were major measurement issues, in that the IQ scores were a mixture from 3 different IQ tests.

		<p>
			Wallach and Kogan[64] administered 5 measures of creativity, each of which resulted in a score for originality and fluency; and 10 measures of general intelligence to 151 5th grade children. These tests were untimed, and given in a game-like manner (aiming to facilitate creativity). Inter-correlations between creativity tests were on average <em>r</em> = .41. Inter-correlations between intelligence measures were on average <em>r</em> = .51 with each other. Creativity tests and intelligence measures correlated <em>r</em> = .09.
